Steroidal 17-carbonyl reduction is crucial to the production of natural bioactive
steroid medicines, boldenone (BD) is one of the important C17-hydroxylated
steroids. Although efforts have been made to produce BD through
biotransformation, the challenge of complex transformation process, high
substrates cost, and low catalytic efficiencies have yet to be mastered.
Phytosterol (PS) is the most widely accepted substrate for the production of
steroid medicines due to its similar foundational structure and ubiquitous
sources. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) and its native electron donor 
play significant roles in the 17β-carbonyl reduction reaction of steroids. In
this study, we bridged 17βHSD with a cofactor regeneration strategy in
Mycobacterium neoaurum to establish a one-step biocatalytic carbonyl reduction
strategy for efficient biosynthesis of BD from PS for the first time. After
investigating different intracellular electron transfer strategies, we rationally
designed the engineered strain with co-expression of 17βhsd and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene in M. neoaurum. With establishment
of an intracellular cofactor regeneration strategy, the ratio of [NADPH]/[NADP+] 
was maintained at a relatively high level, the yield of BD increased from 17% (in
MNR M3M-ayr1S.c) to 78% (in MNR M3M-ayr1&g6p with glucose supplementation), and
the productivity was increased by 6.5 times. Furthermore, under the optimal
glucose supplementation condition, the yield of BD reached 82%, which is the
highest yield reported by transformation from PS with one-step. This study
demonstrated an excellent strategy for production of many other valuable carbonyl
reduction steroidal products from natural cheap raw materials. Importance Steroid
C17-carbonyl reduction is one of the important transformations for the production
of valuable steroidal medicines or intermediates for further synthesis of
steroidal medicines, but it remains a challenge through either chemical or
biological synthesis. Phytosterol can be obtained from low-cost residue of waste 
natural materials, and it is preferred as the economical and applicable substrate
for steroid medicines production by Mycobacterium. This study explored a green
and efficient one-step biocatalytic carbonyl reduction strategy for direct
conversion of phytosterol to C17-hydroxylated steroids by bridging
17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with a cofactor regeneration strategy in
Mycobacterium neoaurum. This work has practical value for the production of many 
valuable hydroxylated steroids from natural cheap raw materials.

Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV) is fermented by multispecies microorganism with
solid-state fermentation (SSF) technology, which contains a variety of organic
acids. However, the metabolic network of them in SSF is still unclear. In this
study, metagenomics technology was used to reveal the microbial community and
functional genes in SAV fermentation. The metabolic network of key organic acids 
with taste active value higher than 1 was reconstructed for the first time,
including acetate, lactate, malate, citrate, succinate, and tartrate. The results
show pyruvate is the core compound in the metabolic network of organic acids.
Metabolic pathway of acetate plays a pivotal role in this network, and acetate
has regulatory function on metabolism of other organic acids. Acetobacter and
Lactobacillus are the predominant genera for organic acid metabolism in SSF of
SAV. This is also the first report on metabolic network of organic acids in
cereal vinegar, adding new knowledge on the flavor substance metabolism during
multispecies fermentation of traditional fermented food.

Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV), a traditional Chinese cereal vinegar, is produced
using solid-state fermentation (SSF) technology. Organic acids are the key flavor
compounds of vinegar. However, the metabolic mechanism of organic acids during
SSF process is still unclear. In this study, metatranscriptomics was used to
explore the metabolic profile of main organic acids in SSF. The results show that
carbon metabolism is the dominant pathway during fermentation, among which
pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis and starch and sucrose metabolism associated with
organic acids were the most abundant. The metabolic pathways of acetic acid and
lactic acid shift from acetyl-P and pyruvate pathways at early and middle-early
stages of fermentation to acetaldehyde and L-lactaldehyde pathways at later
stages, respectively, and Lactobacillus and Acetobacter are the predominant
microorganisms contributed to them. Temperature and acetic acid are proven to be 
the environmental factors that regulate the metabolic activity during SSF. This
study sheds new lights on metabolism of flavor substances in the spontaneous
ecosystems of traditional fermented food.

Melanoidins, are of increasing interest for their potential biological
activities. However, little knowledge is available on their structure. In the
present study, vinegar, coffee and model melanoidins were degraded by NaBH4, and 
the resultant reaction products were characterised by chromatography, mass
spectrometry and spectrometry methods to elucidate the mechanism of formation of 
melanoidin skeleton molecules. The study identified a typical polymer with a
molecular weight (MW) interval of 74 Da, which was polymerised by aldol
condensation and reduced by NaBH4, followed by intermolecular dehydration. MW of 
the theoretically derived typical polymers matched the detected polymers,
validating the speculated pathway involved in the formation of melanoidins
skeleton molecules. The study also revealed that melanoidins from different
sources contain polymers with the same MW and different binding preferences,
contributing to the heterogeneity of melanoidins. Overall, these findings
indicated that the identified polymers could be used as potential candidate
biomarkers for melanoidins.

Bioaugmentation technology may be an effective strategy to improve the
solid-state fermentation rate and utilization of raw materials for traditional
vinegar production. The relationship between bacteria and fermentation process
was analyzed to rationally design and perform bioaugmented solid-state
fermentation of the Tianjin Duliu mature vinegar (TDMV). Fermentation process was
highly correlated with Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus contents,
which were the core functional microorganisms in TDMV fermentation. Pediococcus
acidilactici AAF1-5 was selected from 20 strains to fortify the fermentation due 
to its acidity and thermal tolerance. Bioaugmentation was performed in the upper 
layer of TDMV fermentation. P. acidilactici AAF1-5 colonized and then spread into
the lower layer to improve the fermentation. Result showed that the fermentation 
period was 5 days less than that of the control. Meanwhile, the non-volatile
acid, lactic acid, amino nitrogen, and reducing sugar contents in the
bioaugmented TDMV increased by 53%, 14%, 32%, and 36%, respectively, compared
with those in the control. Bioaugmentation with P. acidilactici AAF1-5 not only
improved the utilization of starch from 79% to 83% but also increased the
bacterial community diversity.

Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV), a Chinese traditional vinegar, is produced by various 
microorganisms. Ammonium is an important nitrogen source for microorganisms and a
key intermediate for the utilization of non-ammonium nitrogen sources. In this
work, an ammonium metabolic network during SAV fermentation was constructed
through the meta-transcriptomic analysis of in situ samples, and the potential
mechanism of acid affecting ammonium metabolism was revealed. The results showed 
that ammonium was enriched as the acidity increased. Meta-transcriptomic analysis
showed that the conversion of glutamine to ammonia is the key pathway of ammonium
metabolism in vinegar and that Lactobacillus and Acetobacter are the dominant
genera. The construction and analysis of the metabolic network showed that amino 
acid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway and energy
metabolism were enhanced to resist acid damage to the intracellular environment
and cell structures. The enhancement of nitrogen assimilation provides nitrogen
for metabolic pathways that resist acid cytotoxicity. In addition, the
concentration gradient allows ammonium to diffuse outside the cell, which causes 
ammonium to accumulate during fermentation.

Background: The industrial vinegar residue (VR) from solid-state fermentation,
mainly cereals and their bran, will be a potential feedstock for future biofuels 
because of their low cost and easy availability. However, utilization of VR for
butanol production has not been as much optimized as other sources of
lignocellulose, which mainly stem from two key elements: (i) high biomass
recalcitrance to enzymatic sugar release; (ii) lacking of suitable industrial
biobutanol production strain. Though steam explosion has been proved effective
for bio-refinery, few studies report SE for VR pretreatment. Much of the relevant
knowledge remains unknown. Meanwhile, recent efforts on rational metabolic
engineering approaches to increase butanol production in Clostridium strain are
quite limited. In this study, we assessed the impact of SE pretreatment,
enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics, overall sugar recovery and applied atmospheric and
room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutant method for the Clostridium strain
development to solve the long-standing problem.
Results: SE pretreatment was first performed. At the optimal condition, 29.47% of
glucan, 71.62% of xylan and 22.21% of arabinan were depolymerized and obtained in
the water extraction. In the sequential enzymatic hydrolysis process, enzymatic
hydrolysis rate was increased by 13-fold compared to the VR without pretreatment 
and 19.60 g glucose, 15.21 g xylose and 5.63 g arabinose can be obtained after
the two-step treatment from 100 g VR. Porous properties analysis indicated that
steam explosion can effectively generate holes with diameter within 10-20 nm.
Statistical analysis proved that enzymatic hydrolysis rate of VR followed the
Pseudop-second-order kinetics equation and the relationship between SE severity
and enzymatic hydrolysis rate can be well revealed by Boltzmann model. Finally, a
superior inhibitor-tolerant strain, Clostridium acetobutylicum Tust-001, was
generated with ARTP treatment. The water extraction and enzymolysis liquid
gathered were successfully fermented, resulting in butanol titer of 7.98 g/L and 
12.59 g/L of ABE.
Conclusions: SE proved to be quite effective for VR due to high fermentable sugar
recovery and enzymatic hydrolysate fermentability. Inverse strategy employing
ARTP and repetitive domestication for strain breeding is quite feasible,
providing us with a new tool for solving the problem in the biofuel fields.

The electricigens with high-electroactivity is essential for resolving the low
electricity power output (EPT) of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, the
manipulation by single functional genes shows limitation because electroactivity 
is a complex phenotype controlled by multiple genes. Herein, global regulator
engineering (GRE) was developed to optimize the electroactivity of an isolated
strain (Pseudomonas aeruginosa P3-A-11) using an exogenous global regulator IrrE 
(ionizing radiation resistance E linkage group) as an object. The GRE was
implemented through in vitro random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR and in vivo
high-through screening comprised of cultures color assay, PYO measurement and
MFCs operation. Four mutants with higher electroactivity were obtained, among
which, the mutant 11/M2-59 not only displayed the maximal power density, but also
exhibited stronger salt tolerance, consequently showing good performance of MFCs 
in the presence of salt. Apart from the reduced internal resistance, the increase
in phenazines amounts primarily contributed to EPT improvement, which was
realized by enhancing the core biosynthesis pathway and affecting other pathways 
(such as central metabolism pathway, quorum sensing system, regulatory network). 
Notably, IrrE exerted its positive effect on electroactivity even without native 
regulators (such as PmpR and RpoS). In addition, the significant fluctuations in 
expression levels of stress-responsive genes mediated by GRE were closely
associated with the enhanced salt tolerance. This work demonstrated that GRE was 
an effective approach for simultaneously optimizing multiple phenotypes (such as 
electroactivity and stress tolerance), and thus would provide more opportunities 
to create high-efficiency electricigens and further promoted the practical
application of MFCs.

Androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) and androst-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) are valuable
steroid pharmaceutical intermediates obtained by soybean phytosterol
biotransformation by Mycobacterium Cyclodextrins (CDs) are generally believed to 
be carriers for phytosterol delivery and can improve the production of AD and ADD
due to their effects on steroid solubilization and alteration in cell wall
permeability for steroids. To better understand the mechanisms of CD promotion,
we performed proteomic quantification of the effects of hydroxypropyl-β-CD
(HP-β-CD) on phytosterol metabolism in Mycobacterium neoaurum TCCC 11978 C2.
Perturbations are observed in steroid catabolism and glucose metabolism by adding
HP-β-CD in a phytosterol bioconversion system. AD and ADD, as metabolic products 
of phytosterol, are toxic to cells, with inhibited cell growth and biocatalytic
activity. Treatment of mycobacteria with HP-β-CD relieves the inhibitory effect
of AD(D) on the electron transfer chain and cell growth. These results
demonstrate the positive relationship between HP-β-CD and phytosterol metabolism 
and give insight into the complex functions of CDs as mediators of the regulation
of sterol metabolism.IMPORTANCE Phytosterols from soybean are low-cost
by-products of soybean oil production and, owing to their good bioavailability in
mycobacteria, are preferred as the substrates for steroid drug production via
biotransformation by Mycobacterium However, the low level of production of
steroid hormone drugs due to the low aqueous solubility (below 0.1 mmol/liter) of
phytosterols limits the commercial use of sterol-transformed strains. To improve 
the bioconversion of steroids, cyclodextrins (CDs) are generally used as an
effective carrier for the delivery of hydrophobic steroids to the bacterium. CDs 
improve the biotransformation of steroids due to their effects on steroid
solubilization and alterations in cell wall permeability for steroids. However,
studies have rarely reported the effects of CDs on cell metabolic pathways
related to sterols. In this study, the effects of hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD) on
the expression of enzymes related to steroid catabolic pathways in Mycobacterium 
neoaurum were systematically investigated. These findings will improve our
understanding of the complex functions of CDs in the regulation of sterol
metabolism and guide the application of CDs to sterol production.

The biotransformation of phytosterol to androstenedione (AD) by mycobacteria is a
unique process accompanied by energy-producing. However, high intracellular ATP
content can severely inhibit the efficient production of AD. In this study, a
novel citrate-based ATP futile cycle (AFC) and pyruvate-based AFC were
constructed for the first time. Application of AFCs reduced intracellular ATP and
propionyl-CoA levels and increased NAD+/NADH ratios and cell viability. The
forced consumption of ATP promotes the transcription of critical genes in
propionyl-CoA metabolism. The synergistic effect of enhanced propionyl-CoA
metabolism and AFC increased AD conversion yield from 60.6% to 97.3%. The AD
productivity was further improved by repeated batch fermentation using untreated 
cane molasses. The maximum productivity was 181% higher than that of the original
strain. Therefore, the strategy of combining AFC and repeated batch fermentation 
is a valuable tool for the efficient and low-cost production of AD and other
steroidal pharmaceutical precursors.

Chitin deacetylase (CDA) can hydrolyse the acetamido group of chitin polymers to 
produce chitosans, which are used in various fields including the biomedical and 
pharmaceutical industries, food production, agriculture, and water treatment. CDA
represents a more environmentally-friendly and easier to control alternative to
the chemical methods currently utilised to produce chitosans from chitin;
however, the majority of identified CDAs display activity toward
low-molecular-weight oligomers and are essentially inactive toward polymeric
chitin or chitosans. Therefore, it is important to identify novel CDAs with
activity toward polymeric chitin and chitosans. In this study, we isolated the
bacterium Rhodococcus equi F6 from a soil sample and showed that it expresses a
novel CDA (ReCDA), whose activity toward 4-nitroacetanilide reached 19.20 U/mL/h 
during fermentation and was able to deacetylate polymeric chitin, colloidal
chitin, glycol-chitin, and chitosan. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ReCDA 
is unique to the R. equi F6 genome, while phylogenetic analysis indicated that
ReCDA is evolutionarily distant from other CDAs. In conclusion, ReCDA isolated
from the R. equi F6 strain expands the known repertoire of CDAs and could be used
to deacetylate polymeric chitosans and chitin in industrial applications.

BACKGROUND: Androstenedione (AD) is an important steroid medicine intermediate
that is obtained via the degradation of phytosterols by mycobacteria. The
production process of AD is mainly the degradation of the phytosterol aliphatic
side chain, which is accompanied by the production of propionyl CoA. Excessive
accumulation of intracellular propionyl-CoA produces a toxic effect in
mycobacteria, which restricts the improvement of production efficiency. The
2-methylcitrate cycle pathway (MCC) plays a significant role in the
detoxification of propionyl-CoA in bacterial. The effect of the MCC on
phytosterol biotransformation in mycobacteria has not been elucidated in detail. 
Meanwhile, reducing fermentation cost has always been an important issue to be
solved in the optimizing of the bioprocess.
RESULTS: There is a complete MCC in Mycobacterium neoaurum (MNR), prpC, prpD and 
prpB in the prp operon encode methylcitrate synthase, methylcitrate dehydratase
and methylisocitrate lyase involved in MCC, and PrpR is a specific
transcriptional activator of prp operon. After the overexpression of prpDCB and
prpR in MNR, the significantly improved transcription levels of prpC, prpD and
prpB were observed. The highest conversion ratios of AD obtained by MNR-prpDBC
and MNR-prpR increased from 72.3 ± 2.5% to 82.2 ± 2.2% and 90.6 ± 2.6%,
respectively. Through enhanced the PrpR of MNR, the in intracellular
propionyl-CoA levels decreased by 43 ± 3%, and the cell viability improved by
22 ± 1% compared to MNR at 96 h. The nitrogen transcription regulator GlnR
repressed prp operon transcription in a nitrogen-limited medium. The glnR
deletion enhanced the transcription level of prpDBC and the biotransformation
ability of MNR. MNR-prpR/ΔglnR was constructed by the overexpression of prpR in
the glnR-deleted strain showed adaptability to low nitrogen. The highest AD
conversion ratio by MNR-prpR/ΔglnR was 92.8 ± 2.7% at low nitrogen level, which
was 1.4 times higher than that of MNR.
CONCLUSION: Improvement in phytosterol biotransformation after the enhancement of
propionyl-CoA metabolism through the combined modifications of the prp operon and
glnR of mycobacteria was investigated for the first time. The overexpress of prpR
in MNR can increase the transcription of essential genes (prpC, prpD and prpB) of
MCC, reduce the intracellular propionyl-CoA level and improve bacterial
viability. The knockout of glnR can enhance the adaptability of MNR to the
nitrogen source. In the MNRΔglnR strain, overexpress of prpR can achieve
efficient production of AD at low nitrogen levels, thus reducing the production
cost. This strategy provides a reference for the economic and effective
production of other valuable steroid metabolites from phytosterol in the
pharmaceutical industry.

Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar (ZAV) is one of the famous Chinese vinegars, which
contains various physicochemical and bioactive compositions. In the present
study, physicochemical properties and total antioxidant activity were detected in
ZAV samples. The correlation between of organic acids, amino acids, phenolic
compounds, and the antioxidant activity of ZAV were explored. The results showed 
that contents of total acids, soluble solids, reducing sugar and total
antioxidant activity in ZAV were increased with aging time, and those in ZAV-5
were the highest. Organic acids and amino acids exhibited weak antioxidant
activity, while phenolic compounds had higher antioxidant ability. In addition,
amino acids had synergistic effect on the antioxidant activity of phenolic
compounds, whereas organic acids inhibited the antioxidant activity of phenolic
compounds. Moreover, it was found that phenolic compounds including catechin,
vanillic acid and syringic acid showed higher contribution rates to antioxidant
activities of mixed phenolic compounds. In conclusion, these findings would
provide references to control the antioxidant characteristic of vinegar through
regulating the main compositions, and further improve the quality of vinegar
production.

Production of androstenedione (AD) and 9α-hydroxyandrostenedione (9α-OH-AD) by
recombinant mycobacteria using untreated cane molasses and hydrolysate of
mycobacterial cells (HMC) was investigated for the first time. B-vitamins feeding
experiment and reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that propionyl-CoA
carboxylase (PCC) plays an important role in the phytosterol biotransformation of
mycobacteria. The respective AD and 9α-OH-AD conversion ratios were increased by 
2.91 and 1.48 times through coexpression of PCC and NADH dehydrogenase. The
highest conversion ratios of AD and 9α-OH-AD obtained by using a co-feeding
strategy of cane molasses and HMC reached 96.38% and 95.04%, respectively, and
the total costs of carbon and nitrogen sources for the culture medium were
reduced by 29.89% and 49.49%, respectively. Taking the results together,
untreated cane molasses and HMC can be used for the economical production of
steroidal pharmaceutical precursors by mycobacteria. This study offers an
economical and green strategy for steroidal pharmaceutical precursor production.

Collaborative microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit
appealing functions for enhanced production of natural products, which provides
new possibility for biotechnology development. In this study, we bridged
Mycobacterium neoaurum with Pichia pastoris to establish a step-wise
biotransformation strategy for efficient biosynthesis of boldenone (BD) from
phytosterol (PS). Firstly, the producing strains were rationally designed with
overexpression of 3-ketosteroid-Δ1-dehydrogenase (KsdD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (17βHSD) in M. neoaurum and P. pastoris, respectively. Then, to
shorten the total biotransformation process and provide reducing power,
semi-batch fermentation strategy and glucose supplementation strategy were
introduced at side-chain degradation stage and carbonyl reduction stage,
respectively. Under the optimal transformation conditions, the productivity of BD
was increased from 10% to 76% and the total biotransformation process was
shortened by 41.7%, which is the shortest among the ever reported. Our results
demonstrated an excellent biological strategy for production of many other
valuable microbial products from bioresources.

The bioprocess for producing androstenedione (AD) from phytosterols by using
Mycobacterium neoaurum is hindered by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD+
and NADH) ratio imbalance, insoluble substrate, and lengthy biotransformation
period. This study aims to improve the efficiency of AD production through a
combined application of cofactor, solvent, and fermentation engineering
technologies. Through the enhanced type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-II), the
NAD+/NADH ratio and ATP levels increased; the release of reactive oxygen species 
decreased by 42.32%, and the cell viability improved by 54.17%. In
surfactant-waste cooking oil-water media, the conversion of phytosterol increased
from 23.92% to 94.98%. Repeated batch culture successfully reduced the
biotransformation period from 30 to 17 days, the productivity was 13.75 times
more than the parent strain. This study is the first to improve the productivity 
of AD by enhancing NDH-II and provides a new strategy to increase the
accumulation of NAD+-dependent metabolites during biotransformation.

Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV) is known as famous fermented food in China. During the 
brewing process, a large number of nutritional substances and bioactive compounds
are produced, which have beneficial effects on human body. In this study, the
contents of nutritional compositions including proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
organic acids, and amino acids were determined in SAV samples. The antioxidant
compounds and properties of SAV with different aging time were also evaluated.
The results showed that the contents of proteins, crude fats, and carbohydrates
in SAV were not changed with the aging time. Moreover, Alanine was the main
component of amino acids in SAV, and the total contents of amino acids were
increased with the aging time. Acetic acid and lactic acid were the predominant
organic acids in SAV. The contents of acetic acid and lactic acid accounted for
more than 90% of the total organic acids in SAV, which were increased during the 
aging process of 5 years. Furthermore, total phenols, flavonoids contents, and
browning index in SAV were also increased during the aging time. These
antioxidant compounds showed a high correlation with the antioxidant activities
of SAV measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power and
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthi azoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. The contribution
of polyphenolic fractions and high molecular weight melanoidins to total
antioxidant activities was similar (about 49% and 48%, respectively). Our
findings would provide new insights to further explore the development of new
vinegar-based functional foods.PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The analysis of nutritional
compositions, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant capacities in vinegars
provides a theoretical basis for the function of SAV. It also provides references
for further explore the development of new-type functional and healthy vinegars.

Androst-4-ene-3, 17-dione (AD) and androst-1, 4-diene-3, 17-dione (ADD) are
generally produced by the biotransformation of phytosterols in Mycobacterium. The
AD (D) production increases when the strain has high NAD+/NADH ratio. To enhance 
the AD (D) production in Mycobacterium neoaurum TCCC 11978 (MNR M3), a rational
strategy was developed through overexpression of a gene involved in the
phytosterol degradation pathway; NAD+ was generated as well. Proteomic analysis
of MNR cultured with and without phytosterols showed that the steroid
C27-monooxygenase (Cyp125-3), which performs sequential oxidations of the sterol 
side chain at the C27 position and has the oxidative cofactor of NAD+ generated, 
played an important role in the phytosterol biotransformation process of MNR M3. 
To improve the productivity of AD (D), the cyp125-3 gene was overexpressed in MNR
M3. The specific activity of Cyp125-3 in the recombinant strain MNR M3C3 was
improved by 22% than that in MNR M3. The NAD+/NADH ratio in MNR M3C3 was 131%
higher than that in the parent strain. During phytosterol biotransformation, the 
conversion of sterols increased from 84 to 96%, and the yield of AD (D) by MNR
M3C3 was increased by approximately 18% for 96 h fermentation. This rational
strain modification strategy may also be applied to develop strains with
important application values for efficient production of cofactor-dependent
metabolites.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are essential microbiota for the fermentation and
flavor formation of Shanxi aged vinegar, a famous Chinese traditional cereal
vinegar that is manufactured using open solid-state fermentation (SSF)
technology. However, the dynamics of LAB in this SSF process and the underlying
mechanism remain poorly understood. Here, the diversity of LAB and the potential 
driving factors of the entire process were analyzed by combining
culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. Canonical correlation analysis
indicated that ethanol, acetic acid, and temperature that result from the
metabolism of microorganisms serve as potential driving factors for LAB
succession. LAB strains were periodically isolated, and the characteristics of 57
isolates on environmental factor tolerance and substrate utilization were
analyzed to understand the succession sequence. The environmental tolerance of
LAB from different stages was in accordance with their fermentation conditions.
Remarkable correlations were identified between LAB growth and environmental
factors with 0.866 of ethanol (70 g/L), 0.756 of acetic acid (10 g/L), and 0.803 
of temperature (47 °C). More gentle or harsh environments (less or more than 60
or 80 g/L of ethanol, 5 or 20 g/L of acetic acid, and 30 or 55 °C temperature)
did not affect the LAB succession. The utilization capability evaluation of the
57 isolates for 95 compounds proved that strains from different fermentation
stages exhibited different predilections on substrates to contribute to the
fermentation at different stages. Results demonstrated that LAB succession in the
SSF process was driven by the capabilities of environmental tolerance and
substrate utilization.

Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV) is a well-known vinegar produced by traditional
solid-state fermentation and has been used in China for thousands of years.
However, how microorganisms and their metabolites change along with fermentation 
is unclear. Here, 454 high-throughput sequencing and denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis were used to investigate the composition of microbial community. 
Metabolites were further analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and
high-performance liquid chromatography. Results showed that the composition of
bacterial community changed dramatically at different stages of fermentation. The
bacterial genera (relative abundance > 0.1%) decreased from 17 in daqu (starter
used in starch saccharification) to 2 at the 12th day of alcohol fernemtation
(AF). 15 bacterial genera at the 1st day of acetic acid fermentation (AAF)
decreased to 4 genera, involving Acetobacter (50.9%), Lactobacillus (47.9%),
Komagataeibacter (formerly Gluconacetobacter, 0.7%) and Propionibacterium (0.1%) 
at the 7th day of AAF. The structure of fungal community was more homogeneous.
Saccharomyces and Saccharomycopsis were predominant in AF and AAF. A total of 87 
kinds of nonvolatile metabolites were detected. Canonical correspondence analysis
showed a significant correlation between the microbiota succession and the
formation of metabolites during the fermentation of SAV. This study provides
detailed information for the fermentation mechanism of traditional SAV.

Initial acetic acid can improve the ethanol oxidation rate of acetic acid
bacteria for acetic acid fermentation. In this work, Acetobacter pasteurianus was
cultured in ethanol-free medium, and energy production was found to increase by
150% through glucose consumption induced by initial acetic acid. However,
oxidation of ethanol, instead of glucose, became the main energy production
pathway when upon culturing ethanol containing medium. Proteome assay was used to
analyze the metabolism change induced by initial acetic acid, which provided
insight into carbon metabolic and energy regulation of A. pasteurianus to adapt
to acetic acid fermentation conditions. Results were further confirmed by
quantitative real-time PCR. In summary, decreased intracellular ATP as a result
of initial acetic acid inhibition improved the energy metabolism to produce more 
energy and thus adapt to the acetic acid fermentation conditions. A. pasteurianus
upregulated the expression of enzymes related to TCA and ethanol oxidation to
improve the energy metabolism pathway upon the addition of initial acetic acid.
However, enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, the main pathway of
glucose metabolism, were downregulated to induce a change in carbon metabolism.
Additionally, the enhancement of alcohol dehydrogenase expression promoted
ethanol oxidation and strengthened the acetification rate, thereby producing a
strong proton motive force that was necessary for energy production and cell
tolerance to acetic acid.

BACKGROUND: Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are widely applied in food, bioengineering
and medicine fields. However, the acid stress at low pH conditions limits acetic 
acid fermentation efficiency and high concentration of vinegar production with
AAB. Therefore, how to enhance resistance ability of the AAB remains as the major
challenge. Amino acids play an important role in cell growth and cell survival
under severe environment. However, until now the effects of amino acids on acetic
fermentation and acid stress resistance of AAB have not been fully studied.
RESULTS: In the present work the effects of amino acids on metabolism and acid
stress resistance of Acetobacter pasteurianus were investigated. Cell growth,
culturable cell counts, acetic acid production, acetic acid production rate and
specific production rate of acetic acid of A. pasteurianus revealed an increase
of 1.04, 5.43, 1.45, 3.30 and 0.79-folds by adding aspartic acid (Asp), and cell 
growth, culturable cell counts, acetic acid production and acetic acid production
rate revealed an increase of 0.51, 0.72, 0.60 and 0.94-folds by adding glutamate 
(Glu), respectively. For a fully understanding of the biological mechanism,
proteomic technology was carried out. The results showed that the strengthening
mechanism mainly came from the following four aspects: (1) Enhancing the
generation of pentose phosphates and NADPH for the synthesis of nucleic acid,
fatty acids and glutathione (GSH) throughout pentose phosphate pathway. And GSH
could protect bacteria from low pH, halide, oxidative stress and osmotic stress
by maintaining the viability of cells through intracellular redox equilibrium;
(2) Reinforcing deamination of amino acids to increase intracellular ammonia
concentration to maintain stability of intracellular pH; (3) Enhancing nucleic
acid synthesis and reparation of impaired DNA caused by acid stress damage; (4)
Promoting unsaturated fatty acids synthesis and lipid transport, which resulted
in the improvement of cytomembrane fluidity, stability and integrity.
CONCLUSIONS: The present work is the study to show the effectiveness of Asp and
Glu on metabolism and acid stress resistance of A. pasteurianus as well as their 
working mechanism. The research results will be helpful for development of
nutrient salts, the optimization and regulation of high concentration of cider
vinegar production process.

Rhizopus oryzae is strictly inhibited by biodiesel-based by-product crude
glycerol, which results in low fumaric acid production. In this study,
evolutionary engineering was employed to activate the glycerol utilization
pathway for fumaric acid production. An evolved strain G80 was selected, which
could tolerate and utilize high concentrations of crude glycerol to produce
14.9g/L fumaric acid with a yield of 0.248g/g glycerol. Key enzymes activity
analysis revealed that the evolved strain displayed a significant upregulation in
glycerol dissimilation, pyruvate consumption and reductive tricarboxylic acid
pathways, compared with the parent strain. Subsequently, intracellular metabolic 
profiling analysis showed that amino acid biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
fatty acid and stress response metabolites accounted for metabolic difference
between two strains. Moreover, a glycerol fed-batch strategy was optimized to
obtain the highest fumaric acid production of 25.5g/L, significantly increased by
20.9-fold than that of the parent strain of 1.2g/L.

[Application of process engineering to remove lignocellulose fermentation
inhibitors].

[Article in Chinese]

Wang L, Xia M, Chen H.

Fermentation inhibitors are toxic to cells, which is one of the bottlenecks for
lignocellulose bio-refinery process. How to remove those inhibitors serves a key 
role in the bioconversion of lignocellulose. This article reviews the sources and
the types of the inhibitors, especially the updated removal strategies including 
physical methods, chemical methods, biological methods and inhibitor-tolerant
strain construction strategies. Based on these, we introduce a new bio-refinery
model named "fractional conversion", which reduces the production of inhibitors
at pretreatment stage, and a novel in situ detoxification method named
"fermentation promoter exploitation technology". This review could provide new
research ideas on the removal of fermentation inhibitors.

Streptomyces tsukubaensis based on genome shuffling and dynamic fed-batch
strategies.

FK506, a secondary metabolite produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis, is well
known for its immunosuppressant properties to prevent rejection of transplanted
organs and treat autoimmune diseases. However, the low titer of FK506 in the
original producer strain limits the further industrialization efforts and
restricts its clinical applications. To address this issue, a highly efficient
method combined genome shuffling and dynamic fed-batch strategies was
systematically performed in this work. Firstly, after five rounds of genome
shuffling based on precursors and product resistances, a higher yielding strain
TJ-P325 was successfully acquired, whose production reached 365.6 mg/L, 11-fold
increase compared with the original strain. Then, the possible mechanism of
different production capabilities between TJ-P325 and the wild type was explored 
through comparative gene expression analysis of key genes. Results showed that
the transcription level of key genes was altered significantly in the mutant.
Moreover, precursors addition enhanced the FK506 production by 28 %, as well as
reduced the by-products biosynthesis. Finally, the disodium malonate and disodium
methylmalonate dynamic fed-batch strategies dramatically led to the production of
514.5 mg/L in a 7.5-L bioreactor. These results demonstrated that genome
shuffling and dynamic fed-batch strategies could be successfully applied to
generate high-yield strains with value-added natural products during industrial
microbial fermentation.

To rationally guide the improvement of isobutanol production, metabolic network
and metabolic profiling analysis were performed to provide global and profound
insights into cell metabolism of isobutanol-producing Bacillus subtilis. The
metabolic flux distribution of strains with different isobutanol production
capacity (BSUL03, BSUL04 and BSUL05) drops a hint of the importance of NADPH on
isobutanol biosynthesis. Therefore, the redox pathways were redesigned in this
study. To increase NADPH concentration, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was
inactivated (BSUL06) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was overexpressed
(BSUL07) successively. As expected, NADPH pool size in BSUL07 was 4.4-fold higher
than that in parental strain BSUL05. However, cell growth, isobutanol yield and
production were decreased by 46%, 22%, and 80%, respectively. Metabolic profiling
analysis suggested that the severely imbalanced redox status might be the primary
reason. To solve this problem, gene udhA of Escherichia coli encoding
transhydrogenase was further overexpressed (BSUL08), which not only well balanced
the cellular ratio of NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+, but also increased NADH and ATP
concentration. In addition, a straightforward engineering approach for improving 
NADPH concentrations was employed in BSUL05 by overexpressing exogenous gene
pntAB and obtained BSUL09. The performance for isobutanol production by BSUL09
was poorer than BSUL08 but better than other engineered strains. Furthermore, in 
fed-batch fermentation the isobutanol production and yield of BSUL08 increased by
11% and 19%, up to the value of 6.12 g/L and 0.37 C-mol isobutanol/C-mol glucose 
(63% of the theoretical value), respectively, compared with parental strain
BSUL05. These results demonstrated that model-driven complemented with metabolic 
profiling analysis could serve as a useful approach in the strain improvement for
higher bio-productivity in further application.

An unexpected promotion effect of Ginkgo leaf on the growth of Clostridium
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation was
investigated. Component analysis of Ginkgo leaf was carried out and flavonoids
were determined as the potential key metabolites. Then the flavonoids feeding
experiments were carried out. Results showed that addition of only 10 mg/L
flavonoids to the fermentation broth can promote butanol and ABE titre up to 14.5
and 17.8 g/L after 5 days of fermentation, that is, 74 and 68% higher than the
control. A 2.2-fold biomass also has been achieved. Furthermore, by employing
such novel founding, we easily exploited flavonoids from soybean and some
agriculture wastes as the wide-distributed and economic feasible ABE fermentation
promoter. The mechanism of the above effects was investigated from the
perspective of oxidation-reduction potential. This work opens a new way in the
efforts to increase the titer of butanol.

FK506 is a clinically important macrocyclic polyketide with immunosuppressive
activity produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. However, the low titer at which
it is produced is a bottleneck to its application and use in industrial
processes. We have overexpressed five potential targets associated with FK506
production (fkbO, fkbL, fkbP, fkbM, fkbD) which were identified in our previous
study, with the aim to improve FK506 production. The results of the analysis
showed that the constructed strains with an additional copy of each gene
increased FK506 production by approximately 10-40 % compared with the wild-type
strain D852. The results of the gene expression analysis indicated that each gene
was upregulated. Combinatorial overexpression of the five genes resulted in a 146
% increase in the FK506 titer to 353.2 mg/L, in comparison with the titer
produced by D852. To further improve the production of FK506 by the engineered
strain HT-FKBOPLMD, we supplemented the medium with various nutrients, including 
soybean oil, lactate, succinate, shikimate, chorismate, lysine, pipecolate,
isoleucine and valine. Optimization of feeding concentrations and times resulted 
in HT-FKBOPLMD being able to produce approximately 70 % more FK506, thereby
reaching the maximal titer of 457.5 mg/L, with lower amounts of by-products
(FK520 and 37,38-dihydro-FK506). These results demonstrate that the combination
of the metabolically engineered secondary pathways and the exogenous feeding
strategies developed here was able to be successfully applied to improve the
production of industrially and clinically important compounds.

for FK506 production improvement.

Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, PR China.

BACKGROUND: FK506 is an important immunosuppressant, which can be produced by
Streptomyces tsukubaensis. However, the production capacity of the strain is very
low. Hereby, a computational guided engineering approach was proposed in order to
improve the intracellular precursor and cofactor availability of FK506 in S.
tsukubaensis.
RESULTS: First, a genome-scale metabolic model of S. tsukubaensis was constructed
based on its annotated genome and biochemical information. Subsequently, several 
potential genetic targets (knockout or overexpression) that guaranteed an
improved yield of FK506 were identified by the recently developed methodology. To
validate the model predictions, each target gene was manipulated in the parent
strain D852, respectively. All the engineered strains showed a higher FK506
production, compared with D852. Furthermore, the combined effect of the genetic
modifications was evaluated. Results showed that the strain HT-ΔGDH-DAZ with
gdhA-deletion and dahp-, accA2-, zwf2-overexpression enhanced FK506 concentration
up to 398.9 mg/L, compared with 143.5 mg/L of the parent strain D852. Finally,
fed-batch fermentations of HT-ΔGDH-DAZ were carried out, which led to the FK506
production of 435.9 mg/L, 1.47-fold higher than the parent strain D852 (158.7
mg/L).
CONCLUSIONS: Results confirmed that the promising targets led to an increase in
FK506 titer. The present work is the first attempt to engineer the primary
precursor pathways to improve FK506 production in S. tsukubaensis with
genome-scale metabolic network guided metabolic engineering. The relationship
between model prediction and experimental results demonstrates the rationality
and validity of this approach for target identification. This strategy can also
be applied to the improvement of other important secondary metabolites.

FK506, a widely used immunosuppressant, is produced by industrial fermentation
processes using various Streptomyces species. However, the low titer becomes a
bottleneck for its application and industrialization. It urgently required a full
understanding of the biological mechanisms for FK506 overproduction. Towards this
end, comparative metabolomics approach was employed to analyze metabolite
concentrations difference of Streptomyces tsukubaensis cultivated in two media
with low and high productivities. Initially, 98 intracellular metabolites were
identified and 13 metabolites involved in five pathways were determined to be
directly correlated with FK506 biosynthesis. Then in-depth analysis elucidated
how those key factors exerted influence on FK506 biosynthesis. Many previously
unreported metabolites were shown to play an important role in FK506 biosynthesis
and provided potential regulation points for external manipulation. Based on such
key information, rationally designed feeding strategy was carried out. Results
showed that the FK506 yield increased from 251 to 405 mg/L, whereas, by-products 
FK520 and 37,38-dihydro-FK506 decreased by 31% and 39%, respectively, compared
with the values of control. To our knowledge, it is the first study to apply the 
comparative metabolomics method to identify key metabolites to promote the FK506 
production. The strategies developed here can easily be extended to titer
improvement of other important microbial natural products and process
optimization.
